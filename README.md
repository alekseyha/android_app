Good to know
This project lets you apply the skills from Joining Data with pandas. We recommend that you take this course before starting this project.

The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former.

Note: This project also uses the plotting libraries Seaborn and Plotly to help visualize the results of some steps. However, the tasks have been written in such a way that you should be able to complete them without any prior experience.
